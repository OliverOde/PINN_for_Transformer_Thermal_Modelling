Abstract: *Physics-Informed neural networks (PINNs) are a novel approach to integrate physical
models to neural networks when solving supervised learning tasks. They have shown
promising potential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using space and
time coordinates as input. However despite their promise, they often fail to train when
target PDEs contain high frequencies or multi-scale features.
Thermal modelling of power transformers is a fundamental practice for monitoring
and improving their efficiency and lifetime.
In this work, we investigate the performance of different PINN models in a specific
1D thermal modelling problem derived to model the heat distribution inside a
transformer. Measurements taken from a real transformer in service are used, which
include the top-oil temperature, the ambient temperature, and the load factor. Using
this example, we demonstrate the strengths and the limitations of PINNs, propose
potential remedies, and provide an overall assessment of the future potential of
applying PINNs to transformer thermal modelling.*
